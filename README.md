### Download youtube audio directly -- QuteBrowser

Qutebrowser a keyboard centric browser, makes possible to run custom userscript written in any language which makes possible to add features as needed.
It is a lightweight browser built on top of PyQt5 toolkit, works with current Python (3.6.x) and has affinity for doing things the unix way - clean, simple, no bullshit.

As with unix philosophy, it can pipe commands with webpage text, current URL etc to your shell scripts or binaries, and can accept commands through a temporary FIFO/pipe back to the browser.
